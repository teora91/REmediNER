## Overview
The monitoring of drug safety (**Pharmacovigilance**) plays a pivotal role in healthcare decision-making. Extracting information from medical case reports helps ensure high-quality health care and maintain the integrity of the patientâ€“physician relationship.  

With recent advances in NLP, it is possible to automatically identify relations between drugs and their side effects, called **Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)**, which is difficult to perform manually due to patients often undergoing multiple treatments.  

This project proposes a **joint model** that provides:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** identifying drugs and effects in raw text.  
- **Relation Extraction (RE):** predicting potential relations between drugs and effects.  

---

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER identifies two key entity types in this project:
- **DRUG**
- **EFFECT**

### Challenges
- Entities are semantically complex and require world knowledge.  
- Open-ended label categories and unbalanced data.  
- Ambiguity and polysemy.  

### Approach
- Entities annotated with **IOB tagging** (`B-DRUG`, `I-DRUG`, `B-EFFECT`, `I-EFFECT`, `O`).  
- Model: **BERT (bert-base-cased)** fine-tuned for token classification.  
- Loss function: **weighted cross-entropy** to mitigate class imbalance.  
- Optimizer: **AdamW**.  

**Hyperparameters**
```yaml
batch_size: 8
learning_rate: 2e-4
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
epochs: 6
````

## Relation Extraction (RE)

Relation Extraction links drugs to their adverse effects.

### Approach

* Entities **masked** as `DRUG` and `EFFECT` to capture syntactic patterns.
* Dataset annotated with numeric labels to align drugâ€“effect pairs (supports one-to-many mappings).
* Model: **BERT + BiLSTM + GELU head**.
* Optimizer: **AdamW**.

**Hyperparameters**

```yaml
batch_size: 8
learning_rate: 2e-4
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4
epochs: 6
```

---

## Dataset

* **Source:** ADE corpus.
* **Size:** 4,272 sentences and 6,821 ADE relations.
* **Structure:**

  * `text`: raw medical report sentence.
  * `drug`: annotated drug span.
  * `effect`: annotated effect span.
  * `span`: character-level indices.

### Data Augmentation

* Concatenated 2â€“4 sentences randomly to create longer instances.
* Final augmented dataset: **12,951 sentences**.
* Introduced implicit **negative relations** (since ADE corpus only had positive pairs).

---

## Preprocessing

* Removed ambiguous cases (drug and effect with same term).
* Lowercased all entities for normalization.
* Removed irrelevant characters, quotes, statistical values.
* Cleaned spacing and formatting.

## Results

### NER Model

| Metric    | Score |
| --------- | ----- |
| Precision | 0.733 |
| Recall    | 0.925 |
| F1 Score  | 0.806 |

### RE Model

| Metric    | Score |
| --------- | ----- |
| Precision | 0.884 |
| Recall    | 0.874 |
| F1 Score  | 0.878 |

> Metrics are macro-averaged across classes.

## Extra Notes

* Attempted **POS embeddings** (via spaCy `en_core_web_sm`) for RE.
* Result: decreased performance + higher computational cost â†’ excluded.
